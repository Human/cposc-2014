**What should I talk about? What kind of talks are you looking for?**

Anything related to Open Source projects, software and community is fair game. Good examples of subjects to choose from include: coding/development, operating systems, project management, networking, web technologies, administration, databases.

You can check out the [CPOSC 2008](http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2008), [CPOSC 2009](http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2009), [CPOSC 2010](http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2010) and [CPOSC 2012](http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2012 "CPOSC 2012") talks on the wiki.

If you have an idea, but you're not sure if it would fit, just email us!

**What do speakers get out of the deal?**

In addition to a satisfying sense of a job well done, speakers will get: free admission to the event (including breakfast and lunch), another cool item to put on your resume, and a photo/bio paragraph on the CPOSC website. And, of course, the respect and admiration of the grateful conference attendees. 

**That sounds awesome! How do I submit a talk proposal?**

You can submit your proposal(s) online this year!  Just go to the [CFP](http://cposc.org/speakers/call-for-participation) page, fill out the form, and hit submit.  Feel free to submit more than one!

**What is the deadline for submitting talk proposals?  When does the CFP end?**

Talk proposals must be [submitted](http://cposc.org/speakers/call-for-participation) no later than midnight on Sunday, July 21st, 2013.  Don't be late! :)  We'll be reviewing all the talk proposals and making selections soon after the deadline.

**Should I present from my own machine?**

We do recommend presenting from your own laptop, if possible. This will provide you with the most flexibility and a familiar environment. Please keep in mind the following guidelines:

*   Projector interface is standard VGA, no DVI.
*   Target resolution should be 1024×768, or lower
*   There will be internet access via wifi, but plan for the worst. The Lords of the Tubes can at times be fickle, so if you rely on network access a backup plan would be advised.
*   Machines break, hard drives crash–we recommend you store alternate copies on different media(burn a CD, thumbdrive, etc.).
*   Send us a copy! To be on the safe side, we’d love to have a copy of your presentation as well. If it’s a slide-based presentation, send it to us in OpenOffice (Impress) format. But if that doesn’t fit your presentation, contact us and we’ll work something out.

**What if I can’t bring my own machine?**

No problem! Contact us, and we’ll arrange a machine for your use.

**How long is my time slot?**

We are still working on the exact schedule, but sessions will be about 40 - 50 minutes long. It’s your talk, and you can use the time however you’d like. We do encourage interactivity with the audience, so allowing 10-15 minutes of Q&A is recommended. But you make the call as best suits your topic.

**How much time to I have to prepare and set up?**

There will be at least 10 minutes between each session. There will also be time between when the doors open and the first session to scope out the room.  There will also be a lunch break and and afternoon break.

**Will there be a speakers’ lounge?**

Yes, we will have a "Speakers Only" room set aside for speakers to relax, make last minute changes, listen to chill ambient beats on their headphones, etc.

**Can I check out the other presentations while I'm at the conference?**

Absolutely! We’d be disappointed if you didn’t.

**Can you pay for my transportation and hotel?**

Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to cover hotel and travel expenses. If you are not from the Lancaster area, please take that into consideration.  

**Where do I send copies of slides or additional questions?**

Email team@cposc.org and we'll answer your questions! :)
